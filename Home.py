    Welcome to the California Wildfire and Climate Data Exploration Dashboard.  
    This comprehensive interactive tool enables users to delve into a wide range of environmental factors that affect the California region, including precipitation patterns, temperature variations, wind speed, and humidity levels. By integrating this data, the dashboard offers insights into how these diverse climate conditions can influence the frequency, intensity, and distribution of wildfires. Users can explore monthly or daily data and trends, compare different environmental factors side by side, and visualize the intricate relationships between climate variables and wildfire events at selected times.
    Dive deep into the data to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends that can help in understanding the complex dynamics of wildfires in California.
